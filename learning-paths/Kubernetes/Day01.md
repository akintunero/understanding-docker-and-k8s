# Day 1: Introduction to Kubernetes

Welcome to Day 1 of the Kubernetes 20-Day Learning Challenge! Today, we will dive into the basics of Kubernetes, its purpose, and why it is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications.

## **What is Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### **Key Features of Kubernetes**
- **Automated Scheduling**: Efficiently places containers across nodes in a cluster.
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers and replaces unresponsive Pods.
- **Scaling**: Supports horizontal scaling of applications based on resource usage.
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Ensures seamless communication between Pods and balances traffic.
- **Storage Orchestration**: Manages storage resources for stateful applications.

## **Why Use Kubernetes?**

Kubernetes solves many challenges in managing containers:
1. Simplifies application deployment and updates.
2. Handles failover and redundancy automatically.
3. Provides a unified API for managing infrastructure.
4. Works across different environments (on-premises, cloud, hybrid).

With Kubernetes, you can focus on building your applications while it manages the underlying infrastructure.

## **Activities**

### 1. **Learn About Kubernetes**
- Watch the official [What is Kubernetes?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) video or read the documentation.
- Research real-world use cases of Kubernetes in production environments.

### 2. **Set Up Your Environment**
- Install Minikube or kind (Kubernetes in Docker) on your local machine:
    - [Minikube Installation Guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
    - [kind Installation Guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
- Install `kubectl` (Kubernetes CLI):
    - [kubectl Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

### 3. **Explore Kubernetes Components**
- Familiarize yourself with key terms like Pods, Nodes, Clusters, and Namespaces by reading [Kubernetes Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/).
