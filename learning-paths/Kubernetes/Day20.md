# Day 20: Production Best Practices

Welcome to Day 20 of the Kubernetes 20-Day Learning Challenge! Today, we will explore **best practices for running Kubernetes in production environments** to ensure scalability, reliability, and security.

---

## **Key Considerations for Production Kubernetes**

Running Kubernetes in production requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. The following areas are critical:

1. **Cluster Design and Architecture**
2. **Resource Management**
3. **Monitoring and Logging**
4. **Security**
5. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

---

## **1. Cluster Design and Architecture**

### Best Practices:
- **High Availability (HA)**:
    - Deploy multiple control plane nodes to avoid single points of failure.
    - Use managed Kubernetes services (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS) for built-in HA.

- **Node Pools**:
    - Separate workloads by node pools (e.g., general workloads, GPU workloads).
    - Use taints and tolerations to control Pod scheduling.

- **Namespace Isolation**:
    - Use namespaces to separate environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
    - Apply resource quotas and limits at the namespace level.

- **Autoscaling**:
    - Enable Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically adjust the number of nodes.
    - Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale Pods based on resource usage.

---

## **2. Resource Management**

### Best Practices:
- **Set Resource Requests and Limits**:
    - Define `requests` for guaranteed resources and `limits` to prevent overuse.
    - Example:
      ```
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "256Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
        limits:
          memory: "512Mi"
          cpu: "1"
      ```

- **Use Liveness and Readiness Probes**:
    - Configure probes to detect unhealthy Pods and ensure traffic is routed only to ready Pods.
    - Example:
      ```
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthz
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 3
        periodSeconds: 5
      ```

- **Use Priority Classes**:
    - Assign priority classes to critical workloads to ensure they are scheduled first during resource contention.

---

## **3. Monitoring and Logging**

### Best Practices:
- **Monitoring**:
    - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring cluster health and application performance.
    - Set up alerts for critical metrics (e.g., high CPU usage, node failures).

- **Logging**:
    - Centralize logs using tools like ELK Stack or Fluentd.
    - Ensure logs are retained for troubleshooting and compliance purposes.

- **Audit Logs**:
    - Enable Kubernetes audit logging to track API requests and changes.

---

## **4. Security**

### Best Practices:
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
    - Implement RBAC policies to restrict access based on roles.
    - Avoid using `cluster-admin` unless absolutely necessary.

- **Network Policies**:
    - Use Network Policies to restrict Pod-to-Pod communication.
    - Deny all traffic by default and explicitly allow required communication.

- **Pod Security Standards (PSS)**:
    - Enforce security policies such as disallowing privileged containers or root users.
    - Example Pod Security Policy (PSP):
      ```
      apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
      kind: PodSecurityPolicy
      metadata:
        name: restricted
      spec:
        privileged: false
        runAsUser:
          rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
      ```

- **Secrets Management**:
    - Store sensitive information in Kubernetes Secrets.
    - Enable encryption at rest for Secrets in etcd.

- **Regular Updates**:
    - Keep Kubernetes components (e.g., kubelet, kube-proxy) up-to-date with the latest patches.

---

## **5. Backup and Disaster Recovery**

### Best Practices:
- **Backup etcd**:
    - Regularly back up the etcd database, which stores cluster configuration data.
    - Example command for etcd backup:
      ```
      etcdctl snapshot save backup.db
      ```

- **Application Backups**:
    - Use tools like Velero to back up application resources and persistent volumes.

- **Disaster Recovery Plan**:
    - Test disaster recovery procedures regularly.
    - Document steps for restoring the cluster in case of failure.

---

## **Activities**

### Activity #1: Configure Resource Requests and Limits
1. Update an existing Deployment with proper resource requests and limits.
2. Verify that Pods are scheduled correctly using `kubectl describe pod`.

### Activity #2: Set Up Liveness and Readiness Probes
1. Add liveness and readiness probes to an application Deployment.
2. Test the probes by simulating a failure (e.g., stopping the application process).

### Activity #3: Implement Network Policies
1. Create a Network Policy that denies all traffic by default.
2. Allow only specific Pods or namespaces to communicate with your application.

### Activity #4: Backup etcd Data (Optional)
1. Perform a manual backup of etcd data using `etcdctl`.
2. Simulate a failure scenario and restore the backup.
