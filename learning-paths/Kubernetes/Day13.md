# Day 13: Jobs and CronJobs

Welcome to Day 13 of the Kubernetes 20-Day Learning Challenge! Today, we will explore **Jobs** and **CronJobs**, which are used to run tasks in Kubernetes that are temporary or scheduled.

---

## **What is a Job?**

A **Job** is a Kubernetes resource used to run a task to completion. Unlike Deployments or StatefulSets, which manage long-running workloads, Jobs are designed for short-lived, one-time tasks such as:
- Data processing.
- Batch jobs.
- Database migrations.

### **Key Features of Jobs**
1. Ensures that a task runs to completion.
2. Can run tasks in parallel by specifying multiple Pods.
3. Automatically retries failed Pods based on the `restartPolicy`.

---

## **What is a CronJob?**

A **CronJob** is a Kubernetes resource used to schedule Jobs at specific times or intervals. It is similar to the cron utility in Linux and is ideal for recurring tasks such as:
- Backups.
- Sending periodic notifications.
- Cleaning up logs.

### **Key Features of CronJobs**
1. Schedules Jobs based on cron expressions (e.g., `*/5 * * * *`).
2. Automatically creates and manages Jobs at specified intervals.
3. Supports concurrency policies to control overlapping executions.

## **Creating a Job**

Here’s an example YAML file for creating a simple Job:

### Example: Job YAML

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
name: example-job
spec:
template:
spec:
containers:
- name: job-container
  image: busybox
  command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 30"]
  restartPolicy: OnFailure

text

### Key Components of the YAML File:
1. **template.spec**: Defines the Pod that will be created by the Job.
2. **restartPolicy**: Set to `OnFailure` to retry failed Pods.

### Apply the Job:

````
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
````


### Check the Job and its Pods:
````
kubectl get jobs
kubectl get pods
````

## **Creating a CronJob**

Here’s an example YAML file for creating a CronJob that runs every minute:

### Example: CronJob YAML
````
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
name: example-cronjob
spec:
schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
jobTemplate:
spec:
template:
spec:
containers:
- name: cronjob-container
  image: busybox
  command: ["sh", "-c", "date; echo Hello from CronJob!"]
  restartPolicy: OnFailure

````

### Key Components of the YAML File:
1. **schedule**: Specifies when the Job should run using a cron expression.
2. **jobTemplate**: Defines the template for the Job that will be created.

### Apply the CronJob:
````
kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
````


### Check the CronJob and its Jobs:

````
kubectl get cronjobs
kubectl get jobs
````


---

## **Managing Jobs and CronJobs**

### Delete a Job or CronJob:

````
kubectl delete job <job-name>
kubectl delete cronjob <cronjob-name>
````


### View Logs from a Job’s Pod:

````
kubectl logs <pod-name>
````

### Suspend a CronJob (to stop scheduling new Jobs):

````
kubectl patch cronjob <cronjob-name> -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
````


---

## **Activities**

### Activity #1: Create a Simple Job
1. Use the provided YAML file to create a Job that prints "Hello Kubernetes!".
2. Verify that the Job runs successfully using `kubectl get jobs`.
3. Check the logs of the Pod created by the Job using `kubectl logs`.

### Activity #2: Create a Parallel Job (Optional)
1. Modify your Job YAML file to include parallelism by adding this field under `spec`:
````
completions: 5
parallelism: 2
````

2. Apply the updated YAML file and observe how multiple Pods are created and executed in parallel.

### Activity #3: Create a CronJob
1. Use the provided YAML file to create a CronJob that runs every minute.
2. Verify that new Jobs are created at regular intervals using `kubectl get jobs`.
3. Suspend the CronJob using `kubectl patch` and verify that no new Jobs are scheduled.

## **Best Practices**

- Use `restartPolicy: OnFailure` for Jobs to ensure failed tasks are retried.
- For long-running or resource-intensive tasks, monitor resource usage and set appropriate limits/requests.
- Avoid scheduling overlapping executions with CronJobs by setting concurrency policies (`Forbid`, `Allow`, or `Replace`).
- Clean up completed or failed Jobs regularly to avoid cluttering your cluster.
