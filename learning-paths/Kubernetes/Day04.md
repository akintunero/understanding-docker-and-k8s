# Day 4: Pods and Containers

Welcome to Day 4 of the Kubernetes 20-Day Learning Challenge! Today, we will explore **Pods**, the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, and learn how they work with containers to run applications.

## **What Are Pods?**

A **Pod** is the basic building block of Kubernetes. It is a logical host for one or more containers that share:
- **Networking**: All containers in a Pod share the same IP address and port space.
- **Storage**: Containers in a Pod can share volumes.
- **Lifecycle**: Containers in a Pod are managed as a single unit.

### **Key Characteristics of Pods**
- A Pod typically runs a single container (e.g., your application), but it can also run multiple tightly coupled containers (e.g., sidecar containers).
- Pods are ephemeral; if they fail, Kubernetes replaces them with new ones.
- Each Pod gets its own unique IP address within the cluster.

## **Why Use Pods?**

Pods provide:
1. **Abstraction**: They abstract away container runtime details.
2. **Collocation**: Multiple containers in a Pod can communicate using `localhost`.
3. **Scaling**: Pods can be replicated easily to scale applications.

## **How to Work with Pods**

### **Creating a Pod**
Pods are defined using YAML files. Below is an example of a simple Pod definition:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-first-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### **Basic Commands**
- Create a Pod:

  ```
  kubectl apply -f <pod-definition.yaml>
  ```

- List all Pods:

  ```
  kubectl get pods
  ```

- View details of a specific Pod:

  ```
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```

- Delete a Pod:

  ```
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
  ```

---

## **Activities**

### 1. **Create Your First Pod**
- Write a YAML file for a simple Pod using the example above.
- Apply the YAML file using `kubectl apply -f`.
- Verify that the Pod is running using `kubectl get pods`.

### 2. **Inspect Your Pod**
- Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to inspect your Podâ€™s details.
- Check logs from the container inside your Pod using:
  ```
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  ```

### 3. **Experiment with Multiple Containers in a Pod**
- Modify your YAML file to include two containers in the same Pod (e.g., NGINX and a logging sidecar).
- Example snippet for multiple containers:
  ```
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx:latest
    - name: sidecar-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Logging...'; sleep 5; done"]
  ```

### 4. **Delete and Recreate Pods**
- Delete your existing Pods and recreate them to observe how Kubernetes manages ephemeral workloads.
