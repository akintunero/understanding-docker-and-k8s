# Docker Projects to Experiment With

### Below are Docker projects for you to experiment with:

1. **Docker Compose for Local Development**  
   Set up a local development environment using Docker Compose for a simple Node.js and MongoDB application.


2. **Simple Load Balancer Setup**  
   Use Docker to set up Nginx as a load balancer in front of two web server containers serving the same application.


3. **Basic Docker Monitoring**  
   Set up basic monitoring for your containers using Docker stats and logs.


4. **Deploy a LAMP Stack**  
   Use Docker Compose to deploy a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and run a simple PHP application.


5. **Simple Web Application Deployment**  
   Deploy a simple web application (e.g., a static HTML site or a basic Node.js app) using Docker.


6. **Basic Python Script in a Container**  
   Containerize a basic Python script that prints "Hello, World!" or performs a simple calculation.


7. **Dockerized MySQL Database**  
   Set up a MySQL database in a Docker container and connect to it from a MySQL client.


8. **Multi-Container Web Application**  
   Use Docker Compose to run a simple web application with a frontend (e.g., an HTML page served by Nginx) and a backend (e.g., a Flask app).


9. **Container Networking Basics**  
   Create a custom Docker network and connect multiple containers to it, ensuring they can communicate with each other.
